kurento-tree-demo
=================
WebRTC broadcasting application implementing model one to many that uses Kurento Tree.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
The project is packaged in a compressed zip file. In order to have the
application running as a service, you can follow the following steps
* Unzip the bundled application
* Move into the _bin_ folder, and execute the script `install.sh` as root
```
sudo ./install.sh
```
This will copy all the necessary files in the appropriate places
* /var/lib/kurento/
** kurento-tree-demo.jar: the application itself.
** kurento-tree-demo.conf: configuration file of the service. Things like
the options for the JVM go here.
** keystore.jks: File containing the certificate to enable secure protocols.
* /etc/init.d/kurento-tree-demo: startup script.
* /etc/kurento/kurento-tree-demo.conf.json: configuration file of the application.
	
The installation script starts the service right after the files are copied. Once
installed, it can be managed as a regular service using _init.d_ 

```
sudo service kurento-tree-demo {start|stop|restart|status|run}
```
or _sysctl_ if it is installed
```
sudo systemctl {start|stop|restart|status|run} kurento-tree-demo
```
